**Please check the [Known Issues](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/618) in case this has already been reported.**

**Please also check if the issue is covered in our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting).** It might be something with a known work around, or where a third party (such as EDSM) is causing logging that is harmless.

**Please complete the following information:**
 - Version [e.g. 4.0.6 - See 'Help > About E:D Market Connector'.  If running from source using git then please paste the output of `git log --decorate=full | head -1`]
 - OS: [e.g. Windows 10, Linux Debian 10.6, etc.]
 - OS Locale: [e.g. English, French, Serbian...]
 - If applicable: Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
 - Please attach **BOTH** log files as follows:
     1. `%TEMP%\EDMarketConnector.log` from *immediately* after the bug occurs (re-running the application overwrites this file).
     1. %TEMP%\EDMarketConnector\EDMarketConnector-debug.log`.  See [Debug Log File](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Troubleshooting#debug-log-files).  NB: If you don't have this log file then you're not running the latest version of the application and should update first to see if we already fixed the bug you're reporting.
